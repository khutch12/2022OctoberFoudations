                This is website is for my <i>Foundations of Web Development</i> 
                class project. I am taking this class and creating this webpage with high 
                hopes of finding an entry level position with a Tech Company. My goal is to obtain a position 
                with a Tech Company by April 2023. I am currently driving a School Bus for 
                STA (Student Transportation of America). Although I am enjoying the experience, I would
                prefer to make money utilizing my interests.

                <p>
                    As you know my name is <em>Kristin</em>. I am from <em>Oahu, Hawai`i</em> and I now reside
                    in Omaha, NE. (If you would like to know more about me, I have provided the link to my Facebook.)
                    I am married to my <em>wonderful husband</em> Bryson and we have been together
                    for 13 years.      
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When we moved here it was a huge adjustment and it may not be exactly what you're thinking. Many people 
                    told us it would be cold and miserable (which it definitely is cold but not at all miserable). Our biggest
                    adjustment was that there are no beaches. We definitely took that for granted. I know for sure, if we ever
                    move back home to Hawai`i, we will appreciate our island's beaches a whole lot more than when we left.

        <h6>Qualities</h6>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>
                    I possess the ability to <b><em>empathize</em></b> with others, allowing me to be <b>kind and considerate</b>. 
                    Although I favor <b><em>indpendent</em></b> work, I put a high value on being a <em><b>team player</b></em>. 
                    A good team player practices <em><b>patience</b></em> and this allows me to <b>endure</b> bumps in the road
                    and conflict with coworkers.
                    Lastly, I am continuously looking for ways to improve my <em><b>critical thinking</b></em> skills,
                    this allows me to think of solutions when problems arise.

                <p>
                    Hawaiians are big on geneology and being able to trace back family generations 
                    and no matter the blood quantum, Hawaiian is Hawaiian. This means to others I 
                    may be perceived as Asian but culturally and how I view myself, <em>He Hawai`i Au</em> 
                    (I am Hawaiian).
