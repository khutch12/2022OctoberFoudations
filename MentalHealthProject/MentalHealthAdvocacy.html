            <br>Smiles are for hiding,
            <br>Never really truly true,
            <br>Is happiness real?
        </p>

            seemed like a fairytale. Tears rolled down her cheeks as the memory of her
            grandfather flooded her mind.
            </p>"When he was alive, we all got along", she thought to herself, "What's going to
            happen to our family now?"
