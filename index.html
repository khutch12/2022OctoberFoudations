        <h1>Welcome to my first webpage!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Kristin and I am learning web development.

        <h2>Before web development</h2>
        <p>
            I was working in a warehouse feeling bored with life and wanting to do something more intellectually stimulating.
        </p>
        <h2>After web development</h2>
        <p>
            My brain is satisfied and I am looking to grow my Web Design Portfolio.

        <h1>Introducing the h1 element! It is 32px by default.</h1>
        <h2>And this is the slightly smaller h2 element! It is by default 24px.</h2>
        <h3>The h3 element is 18.72px by default.</h3>
        <h4>The h4 element is 16px.</h4>
        <h5>The h5 element is 13.28px.</h5>
        <h6>The h6 element is 10.72px.</h6>
        <h1 style="font-size: 48;">But Wait! You can change thsese sizes! This h1 has been changed to 48px!</h1>
        <p>
            If you look closely, you will see that the <strong>strong</strong> element and 
            the <b>b</b> element (bold) look exactly the same on the page.

            and <i>i</i> elements!
