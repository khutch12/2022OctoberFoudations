        <h2>Before web development</h2>
        <p>
            I was working in a warehouse feeling bored with life and wanting to do something more intellectually stimulating.
        </p>
        <h2>After web development</h2>
        <p>My brain is satisfied and I am looking to grow my Web Design Portfolio.
